/*
    Rotating the array by d spaces
    here d can be anything

    - if we rotate the array by n spaces (where n is the no of elements in the array),then the array will come to its original state
    - if the array is of n size and we want to make rotation by n+3 places, it means that n keeps the array same and just we have to left rotate it by 3 places
    - 15 can be 7+7+1 where 7 is the size of array so we have to just perform 1 rotation


    - So the number of rotations that we have to perform is d % n
    where d is no. of places and n is no. of elements


1. Brute force approach
- first store the d elements into a temp array

- then start a for loop from d till n and then we are going to shift the elements towards the left
- so we can write a[i-d] = a[i] so that the elements will be shifted properly to the left

- after this is done then we finally just need to add the elements to the end of the array
- so start for loop from n-d till n, and just do a[i] = temp[i-(n-d)]

- Time complexity can be O(d + n-d + d) - putting d elements into temp, then moving to left, then again from temp to the array
- So Time complexity is -> O(n+d)
- Space complexity is -> O(d)


2. Optimal Solution
- there are two parts of the array
- 0 to d,  d to n
- so we have to just perform 3 steps

- reverse(a, a+d) -> logically arr of 0 to arr d -1
- reverse(a+d, a+n) -> logically from arr d to arr n-1
- reverse(a, a+n) -> logically from arr to arr n-1


// Time complexity -> O(d + n-d + n ) -> O(2n)
// Space Complexity -> O(1) no extra space is used


Note: if the question is asked to rotate the array from the left then we can do the same
first reverse from a+d to n
then reverse from a to a+d
then reverse from a to a+n
